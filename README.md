# Family Tree Management System

This program is a Family Tree Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to create and manage a family tree by adding family members and performing various operations on the tree.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Follow the steps below to run the program:

1. Create a new C++ source file (e.g., `main.cpp`) and copy the entire code into the file.
2. Compile the source file using a C++ compiler. For example, you can use the following command with `g++` compiler:

   ```
   g++ -o family_tree main.cpp
   ```

   This will generate an executable file named `family_tree`.
   
3. Run the executable file to start the Family Tree Management System:

   ```
   ./family_tree
   ```

## Features

The Family Tree Management System provides the following features:

1. Add new members to the family tree: You can add new members to the family tree by providing their name, age, and gender.
2. Show information of a particular person: You can display the information (name, age, and gender) of a specific person in the family tree.
3. Delete the whole family tree: You can delete the entire family tree.
4. Print the names of all people in the same generation: You can specify a generation number and print the names of all people in that generation.
5. Find the least common successor: Given two names, you can find the least common successor (ancestor) in the family tree.
6. Print the whole family tree: You can print the entire family tree in a 2D format using reverse inorder traversal.
7. Find the parents of a particular person: You can find and display the names of the parents (mother and father) of a specific person.
8. Find the spouse of a particular person: Given a person's name, you can find and display the name of their spouse.
9. Find the child of a particular person: Given a person's name, you can find and display the name of their child.
10. Exit the program: You can exit the Family Tree Management System.

## Usage
